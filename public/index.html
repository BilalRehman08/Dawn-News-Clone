        <p id="descriptionMain">The United States announced on Friday it was
            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1607149/un-welcomes-us-revocation-of-yemens-houthis-as-terrorists">
                revoking the designation
            </a>
            of Yemen’s Houthi rebels as a terrorist group
            effective February 16, a reversal by the Biden administration
            which was welcomed by the United Nations and humanitarian groups
            who feared former president Donald Trump’s actions would impede
            aid deliveries to the conflict-torn country facing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
        </p>

        <p>
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called President Joe Biden’s decision to rescind
            the designation “a recognition of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen”.
            <br>
            <br>

            He said the new US administration listened to warnings from the United Nations,
            humanitarian groups, bipartisan members of Congress and others “that the
            designations could have a devastating impact on Yemenis’ access to basic
            commodities like food and fuel”.
            <br>
            <br>

            Yemen imports 90 per cent of its food, nearly all purchased through commercial channels,
            and UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warned last month that the US designation of the
            Houthis already had companies pulling back from dealing with the Yemenis and would likely
            lead to “a large-scale famine on a scale that we have not seen for nearly 40 years”.

            <br>
            <br>
            Blinken’s announcement followed a phone conversation on Thursday with UN Secretary-General
            Antonio Guterres, where Yemen was one of the issues they discussed.
            UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Friday called the US action “extremely positive”.

            <br>
            <br>
            “We hope that helps build momentum for a political solution to the conflict in Yemen,” Dujarric said.
            “I think the reversal of the designation, the naming of the [US] special envoy [for Yemen], and the
            clear, clear language from the top of the administration, from president Biden himself, expressing
            his strong support for the UN-led mediation process [...] are very, very welcome indeed.”

            <br>
            <br>
            In 2014, the rebel Houthis overran the capital, Sanaa, and much of Yemen’s north, driving the
            government into exile. A US-backed, Saudi-led coalition intervened the following year to try
            and restore the internationally recognised government, but years of UN efforts to get both sides
            to agree to a ceasefire and start peace negotiations have not succeeded.

            <br>
            <br>
            The conflict has been disastrous for Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, killing more than
            112,000 people, creating a humanitarian disaster, and wrecking infrastructure from roads and
            hospitals to water and electricity networks.

            <br>
            <br>
            The State Department confirmed last week that Biden was moving to revoke the designation, a day
            after the president announced an
            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1605632/explainer-what-the-us-ending-saudi-war-support-means-for-yemen">
                end to offensive support
            </a>
            to Saudi Arabia’s campaign against the Houthis.

            <br>
            <br>
            The US announcement came on the day that four
            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1606992">
                United Nations agencies
            </a>
            said more than two million
            Yemeni children under the age of five were expected to endure acute malnutrition in 2021 and urged
            an end to the conflict.

            <br>
            <br>
            On Wednesday, the UN envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, met in Riyadh with the Saudi defence
            minister and other senior Saudi officials as well as the new US special envoy for Yemen, Tim
            Lenderking, to discuss the latest developments in the country “and ways to resume the political
            process”.

            <br>
            <br>

            Blinken said by revoking the terrorist designations against the Houthis, “we hope the Yemeni parties
            can also focus on engaging in dialogue.”

            <br>
            <br>

            He stressed that Houthi leaders remain under US sanctions and said the Biden administration is
            “actively identifying additional targets for designation, especially those responsible for explosive
            boat attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea” and drone and missile attacks on
            Saudi Arabia.

            <br>
            <br>

            Blinken said the United States “remains clear-eyed” about the Houthis’ “malign actions and
            aggressions including taking control of large areas of Yemen by force, attacking US partners
            in the Gulf, kidnapping and torturing citizens of the United States and many of our allies,
            diverting humanitarian aid, brutally repressing Yemenis in areas they control, and the deadly
            attack on December 30, 2020 in Aden against the cabinet of the legitimate government of Yemen.”
